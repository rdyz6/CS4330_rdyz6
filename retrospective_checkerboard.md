# **Retrospective**
## rdyz6 
## 1.Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?
I think I finish my assignment well, and follow all the requirements, and implemented the desired behavior. What I did wrong is the format of lambda expression. About different thing I made, I namely use some different functions, and my GUI is different. The hardest part is the retrospective of relevant Java knowledge, and understranding counstructor.
## 2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?
Although the assignment is little difficult to me, now I understand how it works and implement. 
## 3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?
I follow all the requirements as much as possible, including variable's name.
## 4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?
Have some different. The sample looks more concise, and mine is longer and disorder, and there are some unnecessary function exist. Also, the sample use only one function to control differnet resize function, and I use four; similar like resize function, I use two function control color changing.   
## 5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?
My code need enhance, unnecessary function should deleate. Also, the main function should be more concise.
